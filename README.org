#+TITLE: org-random-todo

[[https://melpa.org/#/org-random-todo][https://melpa.org/packages/org-random-todo-badge.svg]]

This will show a random TODO from your =org-agenda-files= every so
often. It uses [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] to show the notifications â€“ see that package on
how to use other notification methods than =message=.

If you want to navigate to the most recently shown random TODO, use
=M-x org-random-todo-goto-current=; navigate to a new one with
=M-x org-random-todo-goto-new=.

* Installation
** MELPA
If you use [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], you can just do =M-x list-packages=, find
=org-random-todo= in the list and hit =i x=.

** Manual
Install [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]], and ensure you're running =org-mode= version 7.9.3f or
later. Then just put =org-random-todo.el= somewhere in =load-path=.

* Usage
** Manual, loading on startup:
   Put this in your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-random-todo)
  (setq org-random-todo-how-often 1500)
  (org-random-todo-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** With use-package
   I have this in my =~/.emacs.d/init.el= to install it if not
   installed yet, and only load it after I've opened at least one
   =org-mode= file, and use =notifications= instead of =message= for
   this package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package org-random-todo
     :ensure t
     :after org
     :commands (org-random-todo-mode
                org-random-todo
                org-random-todo-goto-current
                org-random-todo-goto-new)
     :config
     (setq org-random-todo-how-often 1500)
     (org-random-todo-mode 1))

   (use-package alert
     :defer t
     :config
     (alert-add-rule :mode     'org-mode
                     :category "random-todo"
                     :style 'notifications
                     :continue t))
#+END_SRC

- [[https://github.com/mwfogleman/org-randomnote][org-randomnote]] lets you go to a random note with
  =M-x org-randomnote=, which is shorter to type than
  =M-x org-random-todo-goto-new=
- https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RemembranceAgents are programs that
  try to suggest /relevant/ information from your personal data (while
  =org-random-todo= just suggest information)
