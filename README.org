#+TITLE: org-random-todo

[[https://melpa.org/#/org-random-todo][https://melpa.org/packages/org-random-todo-badge.svg]]

This will show a random TODO from your =org-agenda-files= every so
often. It uses [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] to show the notifications – see that package on
how to use other notification methods than =message=.

* Installation
** MELPA
If you use [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], you can just do =M-x list-packages=, find
=org-random-todo= in the list and hit =i x=.

** Manual
Install [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]], and ensure you're running =org-mode= version 7.9.3f or
later. Then just put =org-random-todo.el= somewhere in =load-path=.

* Usage
** Manual, loading on startup:
   Put this in your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-random-todo)
  (setq org-random-todo-how-often 1500)
  (org-random-todo-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** With use-package
   I have this in my =~/.emacs.d/init.el= to install it if not
   installed yet, and only load it after I've opened at least one
   =org-mode= file, and use =notifications= instead of =message= for
   this package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-random-todo
    :ensure t
    :after org
    :commands (org-random-todo-mode org-random-todo)
    :config
    (setq org-random-todo-how-often 1500)
    (org-random-todo-mode 1))

  (use-package alert
    :defer t
    :config
    (alert-add-rule :mode     'org-mode
                    :category "random-todo"
                    :style 'notifications
                    :continue t))
#+END_SRC
